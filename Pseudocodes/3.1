Question 3.1

"Could you think about an algorithm that only sometimes needs to run the entire Max-Flow algorithm from scratch to
evaluate the impact of removing all the reservoirs, one at a time? Discuss this in your presentation."

To achieve this, we would first establish associations between each reservoir and the cities it can potentially
reach. When a reservoir is chosen for removal, we would identify all it's reachable cities and determine the reservoirs
that also can reach them. We would then repeat the process for all those reservoirs too, to capture direct and indirect
connections, updating the list of reachable cities until no new cities are found. This step is necessary because by
removing a reservoir, we may also be redirecting the flow of water from other reservoirs, which makes them indirectly
affected.
Then, we would compute the maximum flow using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, focusing only on the subset of affected
reservoirs and cities. This would allow us to avoid running the whole algorithm from scratch in some cases.

Step by Step:

1 -> For each reservoir in the graph, associate it to all the cities that can be reached from it using BFS and
hash tables
2 -> When removing a reservoir, perform the following steps:
  a. Identify all the cities that the removed reservoir could possibly reach.
  b. For each city identified in the previous step, use the unordered map find all the reservoirs that reach it.
  c. For each reservoir identified in the previous step, use the same map to add the cities it can reach
  d. Repeat steps 3b and 3c until no new cities are identified.
3 -> Run the Edmonds-Karp algorithm to find the maximum flow in a residual graph containing only cities and
reservoirs that were identified in previous steps.
