Question 2.3

"Use the results from T2.1. and develop a simple algorithm or heuristic to balance
the load across the network so that, as much as possible, you can minimize the differences of flow to
capacity on each pipe across the entire network. Note that in some cities where the cumulative delivery
capacity is very close to (but still larger than) the cityâ€™s needs, it is likely that every single pipe has a
flow close to its full capacity. First, you should compute some initial metrics, such as the average and
variance of the differences between capacity and flow for each pipe, as well as the maximum
difference. After executing your balancing algorithm, you should show that these metrics have
improved."
